  <main id="mainContent">
    <p>This website lists some abilities and inventory items for Amicia, the lead character in the popular survival game <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/a-plague-tale-innocence">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, and its sequel <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a>. Amicia moves around in cities and countrysides of 14th century France with her little brother Hugo and various friends she makes from time to time, trying to avoid the Count's soldiers and swarms of plague rats. While the two games are quite simiar in terms of her abilities, there are some differences, so I've put them on different pages.</p>
