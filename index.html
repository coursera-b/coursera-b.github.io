  <h1>Assignments from Coursera</h1>

  <p>I plan to use this site as a repository for various assignments from Coursera. I'll keep adding to the list below as I work through new courses/specializations.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="web-dev/">Assignments</a> from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development & Coding Specialization</a></li>
  </ul>
</body>
